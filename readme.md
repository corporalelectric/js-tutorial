# Javascript tutorial

**Disclaimer:**  
This repo is for personal learning so many of the projects are incomplete, and the code may be terrible. I'll try to improve on it as I go.

## Where to start?

1. I've been referring to Mozilla's docs, and you should too.  
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript>.  

2. Go to one of the many online code code editing sites. I've been enjoying CodePen for its simplicity. Here is a [list of online editors](#online-editors-and-sandboxes)

3. Start coding. I have included some examples from [Colin's ES6 tutorials](https://github.com/ocpineda/esNextBreakfast). Clone it, and break things on your local machine or go nuts with the online editors in step 2

## Stuff I played with

- I started using React at work, so I now have a [Boilerplate repo](https://github.com/ocpineda/react-boilerplates) for learning purposes as well as productivity. This will probably get updated often. My notes on React are [here](https://gitlab.com/oscarneedscoffee/notes/blob/master/software/javascript/react.md)
- I keep a bunch of sample code from [books](books) in this repo. It's highly unlikely I'll ever touch this code again. Consider it all throw away

Below are references for you to dive deeper into javascript. This is all a work in progress (like most things on my github account), so things may be incomplete, or outdated. Good luck, fellow padawan!
